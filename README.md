# Sentiment-Analysis-Project

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively. To achieve the objective, 3 classifying algorithms were implemented: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the pegasos algorithm.
